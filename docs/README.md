# Talon Documentation

This documentation is organised around the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework: four types of documentation for different user needs.

| Type | When to use it |
|------|----------------|
| **Tutorial** | You are learning; you want a guided, step-by-step experience. |
| **How-to guide** | You have a goal; you want directions to get something done. |
| **Reference** | You need accurate, neutral facts (commands, config, API). |
| **Explanation** | You want context and understanding (why, architecture, adoption). |
